Scrgl -- OpenGL components specially designed for
games and screen savers:

 * Fully compatible with Voodoo2
   (unlike every other OpenGL component in existence!)
 * Support for dynamic loading of OpenGL drivers
   (even changing between drivers part way through!)
 * Support for mode-changing

Scrgl is totally free: you can do with it what you wish,
with no restriction. www.wischik.com/lu
